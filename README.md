# Module 1 Challenge - Code Refactor

## Description
This project for the UConn Coding Bootcamp is essentially a faux-company's (Horiseon) webpage explaining what they do and the benefits of utilizing their services. The page has working links which bring the user to the section with the same headline. For the purpose of the project, the footer has been hidden from view but still exists in the code. 

The purpose of this project was to consolidate CSS selectors and attributes into as few lines of code as possible, and modifying the HTML accordingly so that the webpage responds in the appropriate manner.
