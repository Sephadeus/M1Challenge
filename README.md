# Module 1 Challenge - Code Refactor

## Description
This project for the UConn Coding Bootcamp is essentially a faux-company's (Horiseon) webpage explaining what they do and the benefits of utilizing their services. The page has working links which bring the user to the section with the same headline. For the purpose of the project, the footer has been hidden from view but still exists in the code. 

The purpose of this project was to consolidate CSS selectors and attributes into as few lines of code as possible, and modifying the HTML accordingly so that the webpage responds in the appropriate manner.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
This project is a webpage which requires no installation. Simply click the URL on Github to navigate to the webpage on the browser.

## Usage
This project can be used by other developers as a reference if they want to build a webpage themselves that looks similar. To do this, right click on the webpage and click on "inspect" under "developer tools".

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
There will be more projects to come. Whether or not they will be similar to this project, it is too soon to say!

## Contributing
 This project is complete for the purpose it was made for. However, if you would like to refine the code more for your own project/practice feel free to do so.

## Authors and acknowledgment
This project was originally created by Xandromus and has been cloned and altered by myself, Sephadeus (Joe Labadia), with minor collaborative effort between study group partners. Special thanks to Chris Lemmon, Nathan Hanisch, Alex Frankhouser, and Stephanie Maldonado for their brilliant teamwork, support, and effort in the study group.

## License
This project has an MIT License which authorizes commercial use, distribution, modification and private use.

## Project status
This project is complete, yet could be revisited and refined with more tools in my tool belt.
